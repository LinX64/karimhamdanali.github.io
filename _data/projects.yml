  abstract: Averroes is a placeholder library generator that enables the use of the separate compilation assumption in any Java whole-program analysis framework. Using Averroes reduces the amount of code that needs to be analyzed by up to 300x, improving the performance of call graph analysis as it becomes up to 14x faster, and uses up to 7x less memory. Averroes is currently used by the major Java static analysis frameworks, Soot, WALA (IBM T. J. Watson Libraries for Analysis), and DOOP.

  abstract: Datalog-based library code summaries. This assumption enables identifying a set of constraints that model the side effects of the unanalyzed library code (e.g., class instantiations and method calls) in a sound and precise fashion.
