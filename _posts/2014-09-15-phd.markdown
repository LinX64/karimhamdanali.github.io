After 4.5 long years, I'm finally done with my Ph.D. studies! It has been a long journey but well worth it. I couldn't have 
made it that far without the continuous support of my amazing supervisor Ond&#345;ej Lhot&aacute;k and the support of 
my family, especially my wife, Sarah Nadi. If you're interested, you can find my dissertation published [here][phd].
