		I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Technische Universit&auml;t Darmstadt, Germany within the 
		<a href="http://sseblog.ec-spride.de/" target="_blank">Secure Software Engineering (SSE) Group</a> led by 
		<a href="http://bodden.de/" target="_blank">Eric Bodden</a>. I mainly work on:
		<ul>
			<li>Designing static analyses to detect misuses of crypto APIs.</li>
			<li>Exploring novel static analysis techniques that incorporate user feedback in a just-in-time fashion.</li>
			<li>Developing various extensions to the IFDS analysis framework.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In general, my research interests revolve around practical static program analyses and call graph construction algorithms.
		More on the projects I have been and currently involved in can be found in my 
		<a href="{{ "/research" |  prepend: site.baseurl }}">research page</a>.

		Just before moving to Germany, I finished my Ph.D. studies 
		under the supervision of <a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/" target="_blank">Ondřej Lhoták</a> in 
		the <a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Programming Languages Group</a> at the University of Waterloo. 
		You can find my thesis: <b>The Separate Compilation Assumption</b> <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10012/8835">here</a>.

		Prior to that, I received my MMath degree at the University of Waterloo in 2010 when I was part of the 
		<a href="http://netlab.cs.uwaterloo.ca/security" target="_blank">Security Research Group</a> team led by 
		<a href="http://rboutaba.cs.uwaterloo.ca/index.html" target="_blank">Raouf Boutaba</a>.
