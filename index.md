Few static analyses make their way to the real-world due to the unrealistic assumptions that they make. I am interested in developing and evaluating various program analysis techniques that can be used in practice by exploring three aspects: scalability, precision, and usability. My interests span programming languages, software systems, and software engineering.

Below is a list of my current and inactive projects.
