Few static analyses make their way to the real-world due to the unrealistic assumptions that they make. I am interested in developing and evaluating various program analysis techniques that can be used in practice by exploring three aspects: scalability, precision, and usability. My interests span programming languages, software systems, and software engineering.






In particular, I am interested in researching the following areas:

* library code summaries
* scalable and precise points-to and call graph analyses
* usability of static analysis tools
* crypto APIs misuse
* JIT compiler optimizations
