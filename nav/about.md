Since October 2014, I have started a new step in my career as a postdoctoral researcher at Technische Universit&auml;t 
Darmstadt, Germany. I am working within the 
<a href="http://sseblog.ec-spride.de/" target="_blank">Secure Software Engineering (SSE) Group</a> led by 
<a href="http://bodden.de/" target="_blank">Eric Bodden</a>. Just before moving to Germany, I finished my Ph.D. studies 
under the supervision of <a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/" target="_blank">Ond&rcaron;ej Lhot&aacute;k</a> in 
the <a href="http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Programming Languages Group</a> at the University of Waterloo. 
You can find my thesis: **The Separate Compilation Assumption** <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10012/8835">here</a>. 
                	
Prior to that, I received my MMath degree at the University of Waterloo in 2010 when I was part of the 
<a href="http://netlab.cs.uwaterloo.ca/security" target="_blank">Security Research Group</a> team led by 
<a href="http://rboutaba.cs.uwaterloo.ca/index.html" target="_blank">Raouf Boutaba</a>.

My research interests revolve around practical static program analyses and call graph construction algorithms.
