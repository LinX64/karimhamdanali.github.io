Few static analyses make their way to the real-world due to the unrealistic assumptions that they make. My primary research interest is to develop and evaluate various program analysis techniques that can be used in practice. In particular, I am interested in researching the following areas:

* partial program analysis
* scalable and precise points-to/call graph analyses
* usability of static analysis tools
* JIT compiler optimizations
* secure software engineering
* GPU/FPGA program analysis and optimizations
