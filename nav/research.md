## Research Interests ##
Very few of static analyses make their way to real-world compilers. This is usually due to the unreasonable 
assumptions these analyses make that might not applicable in realistic scenarios. That is why my primary research 
focus is about designing practical static analyses.

In general, the following areas of research intrigue me the most:

* partial program analysis
* static analyses for Scala
* analyzing dynamically-typed languages
* static analyses in the context of secure software engineering
