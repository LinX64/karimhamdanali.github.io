	<h2>Research Interests</h2>
	<p>Very few of static analyses make their way to real-world compilers. This is usually due to the unreasonable 
	assumptions these analyses make that might not applicable in realistic scenarios. That is why my primary research 
	focus is about designing practical static analyses.</p>
